<h5 class="text-left">Scientists are&nbsp; trying to activate the capsaicinoid biosynthetic pathway in tomato plants. Most hybrid species of peppers have been created through selective breeding and hybridization. To make a spicy tomato, scientists would have to activate the capsaicin pathway that is already in tomatoes. Current research revolves around using CRISPR gene editing to allow for the activation of this pathway.</h5>

          <p class="text-left">Capsaicin is the chemical in chili peppers that give them their spiciness. It is an alkaloid that helps protect them from fungus and mammals. Capsaicin has shown several health benefits as well as interest from the culinary desires for new foods and flavors.</p>

		  <div class= "continer flex-wrap">
		  <p class="offset-xl-1 col-xl-10"><strong>Many people fear GMO foods likely because they don’t fully understand what it means for a food to be genetically modified. The common criticism of GMO foods is that they are bad for your health. Research has shown time and again, that there is no direct link between adverse health effects and consuming GMO foods.</strong></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote"><p class="offset-xl-1 col-xl-10"><i>After more than 20 years of monitoring by countries and researchers around the world, many of the suspicions surrounding the effects of GMOs on organ health, our offspring, and our DNA have been addressed and tested (Figure 1). In the data discussed above, alongside many more studies not mentioned here, GMOs have been found to exhibit no toxicity, in one generation or across many. Though each new product will require careful analysis and assessment of safety, it appears that GMOs as a class are no more likely to be harmful than traditionally bred and grown food sources.<br></i>

          <h2>Summary</h2>
          <p>Given that the research is not complete, there is potential an interest in understanding if the Capsaicin in tomatoes would be the same as that of chili peppers. This would affect the overall health benefit of the food as well as its survivability. I personally believe GMO foods are safe and necessary for people in the 21st century. Whether food is produced in a lab or grown “naturally” the physiology of the food is still the same. If we can either selectively breed or gene-edit makes no difference in the product. &nbsp;</p>
